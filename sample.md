# The Third Eye Awakening

The sensation between your eyebrows is not just a feelingâ€”it's the gateway to deeper awareness.

In Tantric spirituality, this point is known as the Ajna Chakra, or the Third Eye. It is said to be the seat of intuition, insight, and inner vision.

When you meditate on this spot, you may experience a gentle tingling, a subtle pressure, or a sense of lightness. This is the beginning of your journey within.

Embrace the silence, and let the sensation guide you to your true self.
