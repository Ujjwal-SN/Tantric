Business plays a vital role in society by generating employment, contributing to economic growth, and fulfilling consumer needs through the production and distribution of goods and services. It acts as the backbone of the economy by creating wealth, supporting innovation, and fostering competition, which leads to better quality and more choices for consumers. Moreover, businesses contribute to government revenues through taxes, which are used for infrastructure, education, and public welfare. In modern times, many businesses also take on social responsibilities, promoting sustainability, ethical practices, and community development, making them essential not just economically but also socially.
